# Face-Mask-Detection
𝗙𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝘀𝗸 𝗗𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗡𝗲𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗡𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 In the Final Project (Dr. Amr Yousef - EE 429 Independent Design), two of my classmates and I developed a deep learning model (Convolution Neural Network). We have successfully programmed a simple model to detect if someone is wearing a face mask or not. This model has real-world applications. For example, during the covid 19 epidemic, we witnessed public places like malls, stadiums, and government buildings adopt this model with a more sophisticated computer vision model used with cameras outside these buildings to allow entry or not. The model will detect if said person is wearing a mask or not, which will unlock the door to enter.
